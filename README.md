turn a single array of numbers, strings and words into 3 seperate arrays.

1. ordered numbers from 1 to 9
2. letters alphabetised and ordered a-b
3. words ordered by first letter, if first letter is the same, second letter determines the order
i.e.
['i', 1, 8, 4, 'x', 'tree', 'fox', 'g', 7, '3', 'asdf', 'aasd']
